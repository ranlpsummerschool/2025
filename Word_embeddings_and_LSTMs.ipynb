    "The advancement of deep learning in Natural Language Processing is often attributed to the advent of word embeddings. Rather than using the words themselves as features, neural network methods typically take as input dense, relatively low-dimensional vectors that model the meaning and usage of a word.The concept of word embeddings gained prominence through models like Word2Vec, pioneered by Thomas Mikolov and his Google team. Subsequently, various other methods emerged, including GloVe and FastText embeddings. In this notebook, we'll delve into word embeddings using the original Word2Vec method, as implemented in the Gensim library."

It then uses the word embeddings to identify the word that is least similar to the other ones. For example, in the list lstm cnn gru svm transformer, it correctly identifies svm as the only non-neural model. In the list bert word2vec gpt-2 roberta xlnet, it correctly singles out word2vec as the only non-transormer model. In word2vec bert glove fasttext elmo, bert is singled out as the only transformer."

    "We mentioned above there are a number of parameters we can set when training our embeddings. Let's investigate the impact some of these have on the result. Quantifying the quality of embeddings is a hard task. There exist quite a few data sets for evaluating the quality of English embeddings, but this is not the case for other languages or very specialized domains, such as NLP. Moreover, it's unclear what information good embeddings should capture. Should they model syntactic information as well as semantic knowledge? Should they capture semantic similarity, or merely topical relatedness? Often, the answer depends on the end task you want to use the embeddings for.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we'll use a simple method for evaluating our embeddings. We'll count how many times two nearest neighbours in the vector space have the same part of speech. After all, if our embeddings model similarity (and not just relatedness) in meaning, we expect a noun to have another noun as nearest neighbour, and the same for verbs, adjectives, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "First we'll use spaCy to determine the part of speech of all the words in our vocabulary. Note that our evaluation metric does rely on the quality of spaCy's part-of-speech tagging, which may not be very accurate for low-frequency words out of context. Nevertheless, we'll assume it's good enough for our purposes."

    "Word embeddings are one of the most exciting trends on Natural Language Processing since the 2000s. They allow us to model the meaning and usage of a word, and discover words that behave similarly. This is crucial for the generalization capacity of many machine learning models. Moving from raw strings to embeddings allows them to generalize across words that have a similar meaning, and discover patterns that had previously escaped them."
